# Spatial Demography and Web GIS
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Population_density.png)

Understanding how **population distribution** and **migration** shape societies, and how we can use **Web GIS** tools to analyze and visualize these dynamics. This topic connects *spatial analysis*, *health geography*, and *digital mapping platforms*.

---

## Section 1: What is Spatial Demography?
Spatial demography examines how population processes—such as fertility, mortality, and migration—vary across space.  
By integrating **GIS** and **statistical modeling** (e.g., MGWR, spatial autocorrelation), researchers can uncover hidden geographic patterns of inequality.

## Section 2: Why Web GIS Matters
Web-based GIS platforms allow users to interactively explore demographic data.  
They help make population patterns more accessible for:
- **Education** (students learning about geography and inequality)  
- **Policy** (governments identifying underserved regions)  
- **Public engagement** (interactive maps for the wider community)

### Subsection 1: Visualization
Interactive dashboards make spatial disparities *visible* in ways static tables cannot.

### Subsection 2: Accessibility
Hosting course material and maps on platforms like **GitHub Pages** ensures easy sharing with a global audience.

## Section 3: Applications
- Mapping health inequalities (e.g., lung cancer mortality in South Korea)  
- Evaluating migration effectiveness indices (AWMEI)  
- Building interactive national atlas content for education
